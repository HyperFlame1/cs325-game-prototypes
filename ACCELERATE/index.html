<h2>ACCELERATE: Rescue Squad</h2>
This is an iteration of last week's analog assignment.
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are driving an ambulance: race to the car accident before itâ€™s too late!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Car Accident
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel pressured by the time constraint; they should feel that they need to go as fast as possible to win.
They should feel skillful when they narrowly avoid crashing into a car.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Controls: ARROW KEYS
<p>Press LEFT or RIGHT to switch lanes.</p>
<p>Press UP to accelerate.</p>
<p>Press DOWN to brake.</p>
You must get to the scene car accident before the timer ends, hurry! Be careful not to cause your own car accident.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is evaluating a classic top-down racer.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Generally, games like these are about surviving as long as possible and achieving the highest score, but this game has the player race against the clock.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's just a normal day.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A car accident has just occured on the highway! The ACCELERATE Rescue Squad is here to help. If ACCELERATE doesn't make it in time, people will die. Speed your way to
the scene of the accident!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of racing games and games that require quick reaction times should feel right at home.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
There is a 2 minute time limit to reach the accident, so gameplay should not last any longer than two minutes. It is very easy for the game to end before then, however,
if the player crashes into another car.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Get a good feel for how fast Link moves; this is key to keeping yourself oriented.
Sitting in a corner and holding the attack button might seem strong, but can be easily countered.
Baiting your opponent by revealing yourself, and then misleading the direction you run in, and then sneaking up behind them is a very good strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ambulance, retrieved from <a href="http://www.freepik.com/free-vector/cars-collection-in-top-view_795999.htm">Freepik</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
There are a great deal of differences between this digital prototype and the analog prototype from the previous week.
While the game still includes random generation of cars as a major element, the game now relies on skill instead of a dice roll.
The addition of a timer adds the pressure of time.
