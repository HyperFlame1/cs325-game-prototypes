<h2>ACCELERATE: Rescue Squad</h2>
This is an iteration of last week's analog assignment.
<ul>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are driving an ambulance: race to the car accident before itâ€™s too late!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Car Accident
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel pressured by the time constraint; they should feel that they need to go as fast as possible to win.
They should feel skillful when they narrowly avoid crashing into a car.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Controls: ARROW KEYS
<p>Press LEFT or RIGHT to switch lanes.</p>
<p>Press UP to accelerate.</p>
<p>Press DOWN to brake.</p>
You must get to the scene of the car accident before the timer ends.
If you crash into another car, you lose.
If the distance reaches 0, you win!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is evaluating a classic lane-avoidance game with the additional pressure of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Generally, games like these are about surviving as long as possible and achieving the highest score, but this game has the player race against the clock.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The ACCELERATE Rescue Squad is a highly trained team that speeds through traffic.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A car accident has just occured on the highway! The ACCELERATE Rescue Squad is here to help. If the ambulance doesn't make it in time, people will die. Speed your way to
the scene of the accident!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of racing games and games that require quick reaction times should feel right at home.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
There is a 1 minute and 30 second time limit to reach the accident, so gameplay should not last any longer than that. It is very easy for the game to end before then, however,
if the player crashes into another car.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Generally, players will want to hold up for the entire game. However, there may be situations where braking is necessary, such as having to cross three lanes to avoid cars. Braking for
too long will cause you to not make it in time, so use the brake sparingly.
</li>

<ul>
<li>Cars retrieved from <a href="http://www.freepik.com/free-vector/cars-collection-in-top-view_795999.htm">Freepik</a></li>
<li>Song: Super Monkey Ball 2: Expert Race retrieved from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS0vudpnwnc">Youtube</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
There are a great deal of differences between this digital prototype and the analog prototype from the previous week.
While the game still includes random placement of cars as a major element, the game now relies on skill instead of a dice roll.
The addition of a timer adds the pressure of time, and you can change lanes at will.
