<h2>The Missing Link</h2>
<ul>

<li>For this assignment, I iterated on my pass (I made a new game) on the 3rd assignment, which included "invisibility" as a theme.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Two players fight as mirror images of Link, with a twist: both of them turn invisible!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
From the 3rd assignment: Invisibility.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Input: Keyboard</li>
<li>Randomness: Deterministic</li>
<li>Play Style: Competitor</li>
<li>Genre: Overhead, Fighting</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel anxious when both they and their opponent are invisible; you don't know where your opponent is, and they don't know where you are. You might not even know where you are, yourself!
When players win a round, they should feel like out-witted their opponent or simply overwhelmed them by chasing them down.
Players should feel afraid to randomly swing out in the open in fear of exposing themselves to the enemy, but should also feel that it's a useful tool for reorienting yourself.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>CONTROLS:</li>
<li>Green Link: WASD for movement, F to attack</li>
<li>Blue Link: Arrow Keys for movement, L to attack</li>
</ul>

This game consists of one hit KOs; get hit once and you lose!
There are two Links: Green and Blue. When a round begins, the Links spawn on opposite corners of the map.
Players can immediately control their respective Link right from the beginning.
After a brief delay, both Links fade to complete invisibility.
Since players share the same game screen, you know as much as your opponent does!
Attack with F or L to swing your sword. This will attack in a small area in front of Link. If you hit the opponent Link, you win.
However, swinging your sword causes you to become visible for a brief period; you reveal your location!
Bumping into walls will also cause you to become visible.
If both Links bump into eachother, they both become visible.
When you are completely opaque, you cannot swing your sword. This means that when you swing your sword, there's a small cooldown on swinging again.
When you bump into walls or the other Link, you also cannot swing your sword for a short period.
If you and your opponent swing at the same time, your swords will clang and both of you will be knocked back a small distance.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is evaluating the mechanic of invisibility in a multiplayer environment. It also tests the mehcanics of basic Zelda swordplay in a multiplayer environment, but this has been well established.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
You're invisible to your opponent and yourself! Having to track your invisible self is pretty unique.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This is set in the world of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Since The Legend of Zelda is already a well-established franchise, there isn't much to say here. However, if Link were fighting Dark Link, it would be good
for a multiplayer component of a future Zelda title.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of the Legend of Zelda and competitive muliplayer games should feel right at home.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A single round can last anywhere from 5 seconds to several minutes. Theoretically it could go on forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Get a good feel for how fast Link moves; this is key to keeping yourself oriented.
Sitting in a corner and holding the attack button might seem strong, but can be easily countered.
Baiting your opponent by revealing yourself, and then misleading the direction you run in, and then sneaking up behind them is a very good strategy.
