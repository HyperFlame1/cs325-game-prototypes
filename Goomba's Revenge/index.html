<h2>Goomba's Revenge</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avenge your goomba bretheren: jump on the shells and hit them back at Mario!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the revenge theme for this week's game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Input: Keyboard</li>
<li>Randomness: Deterministic</li>
<li>Play Style: Competitor</li>
<li>Genre: Side-Scroller</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel that the game aesthetics are very polished, like it's a real Super Mario World spinoff. The game's randomness shouldn't feel too unfair. Players should feel great when they get a new high score, and also moderately challenged.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Press the spacebar to jump. Jump onto a shell to launch it back at Mario. When Mario is hit by a shell, you gain 1 point. If you jump onto or over a shell, a new one spawns when they fly off screen. If you get hit by a shell, the game ends. Aim for the highest score!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the basic platforming element of jumping combined with a semi-random-speed projectile.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The aesthetics are very polished, due to a majority of the game's assets being borrowed from a triple A game. The role reversal of playing as a Goomba instead of Mario is something that no Mario game has done.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in Super Mario World's setting. Mario has killed your goomba friend!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There really isn't much of a story here. The player character goomba must get his revenge on Mario by chasing him down and launching shells at him! Mario must pay for what he's done.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who are fans of Mario games or platformers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Anywhere from 5 seconds up to an infinite amount of time, due to the infinite scoring nature of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Correctly timing your jump is the only correct strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Loading screen text: self-made</li>
<li>All Super Mario World assets copyrighted by Nintendo; obtained from <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/snes/smarioworld/">Spriter's Resource</a> and <a href="http://www.themushroomkingdom.net/media/smw/wav">The Mushroom Kingdom.net</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The gameplay is closest to the game I took the art from: Super Mario World. Jumping on shells to launch them is a staple of Mario gameplay.
